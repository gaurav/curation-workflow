# Directory for private phyloreferences

Some phyloreferences have not yet been published. They should be stored in this
directory, where they will be automatically encrypted with [git-crypt]. Files with
any name in subdirectories of this directory (e.g. `private/Fisher et al, 2007/paper.json`) 
will be tested by the test suite when it is run.
